Voting Portal Mini Project

The objective of this project is to showcase my coding proficiency in C#, React, and SQL.

This project entails the development of a straightforward voting website focused on a single question, complete with login, registration, and administration functionalities. The frontend of the website is constructed using React, HTML, Javascript, and CSS, while the backend leverages C# within a .NET environment.

Diverging from my previous projects, this endeavor presented a new challenge as I delved into unfamiliar technologies such as React and C#. Despite having experience with PHP in the past, the three-week timeline to complete the project alongside a full-time job posed occasional difficulties. Acquiring proficiency in new technologies is inherently challenging, and this project was no exception. I adopted a self-training approach, utilising online video tutorials and resources like Stack Overflow.

To run the project:

Restore the SQL server data from voting_portal/database/voting_portal.bak to localhost.
Install Node.js.
Open voting_portal.sln in Visual Studio.
